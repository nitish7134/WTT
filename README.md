Team Wintendo Presents



Wheel through Time


Description:
You are stuck in the past, present and future with hostile enemies swarming you in all sides! Try to survive for as long as you can while jumping through portals to travel between time. Your only defence against the hordes of zombies, aliens and wolves is a singular shotgun. How long can you survive?
On starting the game, you will be teleported to the present, where zombies will chase you down. After you kill some zombies, portals will open up, allowing you to travel in time to other time periods, such as the past, where wolves will be waiting for you and the future with aliens trying to hurt you. Try to survive for as long as possible while killing as many enemies as you can.
Each enemy you defeat will get you 1 point. Try to get a high score, and keep beating your high score.


Controls:
